# Reflections
This project aimed to improve my skills in HTML5, CSS3, Sass (SCSS), BEM methodology, JavaScript, responsive and adaptive layout and build the entire landing page positioning elements using all the tools such as flexbox, grid, media queries, etc.

The main challenge was to combine all the knowledge and skills I have acquired so far and implement a landing page from scratch. I had to use all the tools I have learned up to this point and apply them in practice.
